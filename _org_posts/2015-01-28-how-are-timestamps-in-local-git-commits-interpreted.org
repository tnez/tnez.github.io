I am curious. I've commited many times to a local repository in the
past few days. Currently my [[http://github.com/tnez][GitHub]] shows no activity for this period
because I have not pushed anything to remote repositories during this
time.

Howerver, I am about to push the commits from last couple days. Is
this activity reflected in my tiles? In other words, does [[http://github.com][GitHub]]
associate this activity with the time I commited to my local
repository, or the time I pushed to the remote?

Looks like activity on [[http://github.com][GitHub]] reflects the time the commits were made
locally. Good stuff for those who may not post to the remote for a few
days while working all the while locally. *Cool beans!*
