<p>
The following scenario happens to me on an almost daily basis:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I am working on a project / post / idea.
</li>
<li>I run into an issue that is itself worthy of a dedicated new
project / post / idea.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
I want to start working on the new issue as a stand alone project, but
I also need to be able to jump right back into my current project as
soon as I finish the new. This needs to be as seamless and failsafe as
possible in order to keep my focus and productivity high while also
preventing me from losing work.
</p>

<p>
I am almost always working in the branch of a git repository, so what
is actually happening is that I am:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Stashing the changes in my current branch
</li>
<li>Creating a new branch (probably from my master branch).
</li>
<li>Checking out the new branch.
</li>
<li>Doing work.
</li>
<li>Committing work.
</li>
<li>Pushing work back to the master branch.
</li>
<li>Checking out the original branch.
</li>
<li>Resuming work.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
This looked like this&#x2026;
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh" id="workflow-with-vanilla-git"><span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">stash changes</span>
git stash
<span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">create a new branch based off master</span>
git checkout master
git branch new-issue
<span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">do awesome work...</span>
<span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">...</span>
<span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">stage and commit awesome work</span>
git commit -a -m <span class="org-string">"I did awesome work!"</span>
<span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">merge awesome work back into master</span>
git checkout master
git merge new-issue
<span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">remove new-issue branch</span>
git branch -d new-issue
<span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">switch back to our original working branch</span>
git checkout orig-branch
<span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">apply the work that we had previously stashed</span>
git apply stash
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Not soooo bad I know, but I recently stumbled upon <a href="http://www.git-legit.org">legit</a> which
simplifies the process. After installing <a href="http://www.git-legit.org">legit</a>, the process looks like
this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh" id="workflow-with-git-legit"><span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">stash changes and switch to new branch based off master</span>
git sprout master new-issue
<span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">do awesome work...</span>
<span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">...</span>
<span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">stage and commit awesome work</span>
git commit -a -m <span class="org-string">"I did awesome work!"</span>
<span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">merge awesome work back into master and remove new-issue branch</span>
git graft new-issue master
<span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">witch back to our original working branch and apply previous work</span>
git switch orig-branch
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The difference may seem minimal, but any simplification that can be
applied to a workflow that is used on a daily basis is worth it in my
opinion. Switching ideas should be a muscle memory burned into our
fingers rather than something we need to stop and think about!
