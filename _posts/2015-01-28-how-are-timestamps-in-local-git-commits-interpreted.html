<p>
I am curious. I've commited many times to a local repository in the
past few days. Currently my <a href="http://github.com/tnez">GitHub</a> shows no activity for this period
because I have not pushed anything to remote repositories during this
time.
</p>


<div id="before.png" class="figure">
<p><img src="{{site.url}}/public/media/2015-01-28-before.png" alt="2015-01-28-before.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1:</span> My github activity before pushing local commits.</p>
</div>

<p>
Howerver, I am about to push the commits from last couple days. Is
this activity reflected in my tiles? In other words, does <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>
associate this activity with the time I commited to my local
repository, or the time I pushed to the remote?
</p>


<div id="after.png" class="figure">
<p><img src="{{site.url}}/public/media/2015-01-28-after.png" alt="2015-01-28-after.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2:</span> My github activity after pushing local commits.</p>
</div>

<p>
Looks like activity on <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> reflects the time the commits were made
locally. Good stuff for those who may not post to the remote for a few
days while working all the while locally. <b>Cool beans!</b>
